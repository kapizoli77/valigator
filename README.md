## Installation
### Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate Valigator into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:
```ruby
github "https://github.com/kapizoli77/valigator.git" "master"
```

### Swift Package Manager
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. You can add it with Xcode integrated SPM support or manually, with adding this dependency to your Package.swift file
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/kapizoli77/valigator", .branch("master"))
]
```
